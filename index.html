        <p>This is my website! Well basically I will <i>hopefully</i> update this website every day, no matter how small.</p>
        <p>I will be posting about my code projects, my interests and other things that I don't have the capacity to think of currently.</p>
        <p>So, basically this entire website is just my portfolio! Anyhow, I hope whoever is reading this have a wonderful day/night, as I might (?) see you next itme.</p>
